          Hello Doctor, <br />
          We hope this message finds you well. Today, we are delighted to announce
          the launch of Maternity Alert-Monitor, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)
          powered Cariotocography (CTG) monitoring software, by our partner,
          spiker ltd., in Kena.

        <h3>Maternity Alert-Monitor</h3>
        <p>
          Maternity Alert-Monitor is a monitoring software that enables early
          medical intervention by midwives through AI-based automatic
          interpretation of CTG alerts, even in cases of healthcare worker
          shortages and inadequate training. <br />
          It allows 24/7 patient monitoring, enabling healthcare providers with
          limited CTG training to perform immediate medical interventions by
          giving color and sound alerts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key features of Maternity Alert-Monitor are as follows: <br />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Real time monitoring</b> of fetal heart rate and uterine contraction and achieves high computing accuracy in interpretation using AI</li>
            <li>Detects even <b>the smallest changes in variability and deceleration</b> and gives alerts</li>
            <li>Encourages <b>earlier medical intervention</b> by midwives</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          spiker ltd,. is a startup specializing in AI medical equipment
          manufacturing established in Japan in 2020. One of our founders has 9+
          years of business experience in Africa and another is an ObsGyn doctor.
          Since 2020, spiker has been conducting extensive research and market
          surveys in Kenya and other African countries, collaborating with
          obstetricians to incorporate their feedback into the product and
          partnering with AA Health Dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through our study, we found many hospitals still face the challenges of
          <b>understaffing</b> and <b>inadequate training.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Monitoring with CTG is particularly important for high-risk obstetric
          patients, and there is no doubt that early medical intervention by
          midwives is crucial for maintaining and restoring the well-being of the
          fetus. In Japan, CTG has been widely used since the 1960s, and by the
          1980s, it was utilized in almost all deliveries, contributing to Japan's
          perinatal mortality rate being the lowest in the world at 3 per 1000
          births.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with Kenya having only about one-tenth of the healthcare
          workers compared to Japan, achieving the same level of care is
          challenging.
